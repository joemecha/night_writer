## General info
This project is a Ruby implementation of an automated English-Braille
translator, using the command line to open and read a document, converting the
characters and creating a file for the translated output.

_Night writing_ - once a proposed method for soldiers to communicate silently at
 night - was later introduced to blind students including Louis Braille, who
 developed it into the well-known six-dot cell system.

## Learning Goals / Areas of Focus
* Practice breaking a program into logical components
* Testing components in isolation and in combination
* Applying enumerable techniques in a real context
* Reading text from and writing text to files

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Ruby version: 2.5.3

## Setup
To run this program, save a copy of this repository locally. In the MacOS
application 'Terminal,' navigate into the _night writer_ directory. Next, place
a text file (.txt) to be translated in the same directory. Then, run it using
ruby (note: '$' is not typed).

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joemecha/night_writer.git
   ```
2. Change into the directory
   ```
   $ cd ../night_writer.rb
   ```
3. Add your text file.
4. Run _night_writer_ by entering the following into Terminal
   ```
   $ ruby ./lib/night_writer.rb <text file name>.txt <new file name>.txt
   ```
